# JSON Utilities

This repository contains two Bash scripts designed to work with JSON files: `json-merger.sh` for merging multiple JSON files into a single file, and `json-linter.sh` for validating JSON files.

## json-merger.sh

`json-merger.sh` is a simple Bash script designed to merge multiple JSON files into a single JSON file containing a JSON array of the objects from the input files. This tool is especially useful when dealing with multiple configurations or data files in JSON format that need to be combined into a single file for processing or analysis.

### Features

- Combines multiple JSON files into a single JSON file.
- Ensures the output is a valid JSON file by wrapping the contents in a JSON array.
- Simple and easy to use, requiring only the Bash shell.

### Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `json-merger.sh` file directly.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x json-merger.sh`.
3. Use the script by running: `./json-merger.sh jsonFile1.json jsonFile2.json [...jsonFileN.json]`.

## json-linter.sh

`json-linter.sh` is a Bash script for validating JSON files. It uses `jq` to check if a given JSON file is valid. If the file is valid, the script outputs "Valid JSON"; otherwise, it prints "Invalid JSON".

### Prerequisites

- `jq` must be installed on your system to use `json-linter.sh`.

### Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `json-linter.sh` file directly.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x json-linter.sh`.
3. Use the script by running: `./json-linter.sh jsonFile.json`.
